## This will be beginning of python
age = 20 ## variable 
age = 30 ## variable

## Exercise - We check in a patient named John smith
## He is 20 years old 
## He is a new patient 

## Receive input from the user
name = input ("What is your name? ")
print ('Hello ' + name) ## string concatenation

## Type conversion - Numbers, Boolean, Strings - convert the variables from one to another
