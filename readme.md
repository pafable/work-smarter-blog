1. Use [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) to host the site
2. Use [Github](https://github.com/pafable/work-smarter-blog) to house the infra code
3. Use Github Actions to handle CI/CD workflow
4. Use [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) to create a Ghost blog image
5. Use [Terraform open source](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) to provision the droplet (VM's in Digital Ocean) and managed database


## Working on the project
Create a branch with the following name `feature/username/*`

This will allow us to work on separate feature branches without interfereing with each other's work.

When your work is complete open a pull request (PR) against the `main` branch and a repo admin will merge your changes if it passes the status checks.

example branch name:
`feature/your_username/test1`
